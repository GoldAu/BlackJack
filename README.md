# BlackJack
This program is supposed to create a BlackJack game using Java OOP.
The BlackJack file with the main(String[] args) is in BlackJack0.
I need to find a way on how to shuffle the cards and how to make it
so that the Jacks, Queens and Kings of all suits have their names printed
instead of just a number (10).
